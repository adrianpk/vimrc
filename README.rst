Using this .vimrc
=================
Although a .vimrc is a very personal thing, you may use mine if you
like it.  To do so, please do the following:

1. Clone this repo::

   	git clone git://github.com/nvie/vimrc.git

   or download the plain source only::

   	wget -qO - http://github.com/nvie/vimrc/tarball/master | tar -xzvf -

2. In your ~/.vimrc, add the following line::

   	source ~/path/to/vimrc/.vimrc

That's it.
